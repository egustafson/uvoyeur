## Todo's

1. Rename 'daemon' package to 'service'

   A Voyeur "service" is a lightweight agent that runs as a daemon.
   The service should be run on most hosts and act as a localhost
   point of collection for Voyeur telemetry.  The service is then
   configured where and how to upstream telemetry.  

   The service can also store telemetry locally and may provide RESTy
   search access to the telemetry.

   The service should also have a journal like log of the telemetry so
   that upstream agents can catch-up if they disconnect.  This
   supports controlled restart and crash-restart of upstream agents.
